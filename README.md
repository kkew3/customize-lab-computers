# Customize lab computers

This repo maintains a collection of scripts to initialize the lab computers on campus to a familiar environment.
Lab computers are typically installed with disk protection software that reset the computer under certain condition, e.g. reboot.
It soon becomes annoying to customize the computer environment without an automation script.

## Platform coverage

Current collection of scripts (bash shell) have been tested on Mac OS computers in UC San Diego libraries.
There are also scripts (DOS batch) working on Windows 7 computers.
However, recently the Windows computers were upgraded to Windows 10.
This is the reason why I didn't put those scripts here.
